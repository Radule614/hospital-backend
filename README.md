<h3>Hospital backend</h3>
<p>
    University project built with group of 16 people(divided in 4 teams of 4 people). My team was working on integration with blood bank (a different repo). This backend is primarily used by 2 Angular frontend apps, one is cms-like and the other one is a public app.
  Integration consisted of linking a few communication libraries and protocols such as RabbitMQ, Email services, gRPC protocol and so on. For majority of communication with blood bank (and both frontend apps) HTTP 1.1 protocol was used.
